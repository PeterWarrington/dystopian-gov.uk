Addressing the people of this great country outside Downing Street, Prime Minister Boris Johnson marked the beginning of his 6th term in office by paying testament to the work of his Government since it came to power in 2019.

In the televised speech, Johnson celebrated his record in levelling up Britain, reforming the country from the bottom up. He pointed to his crucial work in abolishing the antiquated Houses of Parliament that has continually failed the country, replacing it with a truly democratic people's council with the power to legislate on the people's priorities without impediment by those that do not have respect for the institutions of our country.

Continuing, he said:

"It is this Government's record that is a testament to the hard work of this Government in promoting security and patriotism."

"It is this Government that has kept people safe by prosecuting more people than ever before, and that has bought us a media that truly listens to those that are proud of our country. I have been able to make people proud to be proud of our country once again, and have left no room for those that aren't."
