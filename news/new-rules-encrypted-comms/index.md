The Home Secretary today announced new measures protecting loyal citizens
as part of the Criminal Communication Powers and Enforcement Act that was approved 
by a private meeting of the People's Council on Monday. In a speech to delegates, 
she announced that the regulations ban communication using encrypted messaging apps
that allow Criminals to evade detection and prosecution.

"We can no longer allow anybody in this country to be able to hide themselves
from police. If you have got nothing to hide have nothing to fear, but I say 
to those criminals out there, that we are listening, and we will bring you 
to justice."
