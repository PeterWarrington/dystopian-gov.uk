        About your Social Credit Score.
        </h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">
        The Social Credit Score system is crucial to life in Britain today. A social credit score
        rated "Good" or above provides access to employment, reduced tax rates, 
        subsidized access to healthcare, and much more.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
        A social credit score rated "Requires improvement" or worse means that you are 
        likely to face more difficulty accessing public services, and enjoy life in 
        our country to its full.
